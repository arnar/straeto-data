# Strætó data

This repository contains data files for (hopefully) all publicly available and user contributed static data for [Strætó bs.][straeto] which provides the public transportation for the greater Reykjavík area.

## Which data is available

- [List of all stops](https://github.com/gudmundur/straeto-data/blob/master/stops/allStops.csv).
- Stops in order per direction, for all routes available in the [real-time feed][realtimefeed].
- [Rough route paths](https://github.com/gudmundur/straeto-data/blob/master/routes/routes.json).
- Estimated timetables.

## Route stops

In the `stops` folder, the files are named as such 

	routeNr-direction-endStop[variant].csv

For example route 1 going from Hlemmur towards Klukkuvellir is named `1-A-Klukkuvellir.csv`. A few routes have either branches or take different routes at certain times a day, thus have a variant, such as `12-A-Breiðhöfði_Ártún-1.csv`.

## Route paths

The routes data is included in the `routes` folder. The format should be fairly self-explanatory but one should be aware that the data is drafted up in Google Earth so it is far from perfect.

## Estimated timetables

Estimated timetables have been generated by combining the route stops and [scraped][scraper] data from [Strætó][straeto]'s website. The estimation is done by calculating the distance between each stop on a route, and from the scraped data, missing times are inferred.

In the `timetables` folder, the same naming pattern is used as for the route stops above. Within each folder the trips are grouped by day and within those sorted by time.

The format of each CSV file is `stopId,time,source`, where the `stopId`and `time`are self explanatory. The `source` denotes where the data comes from, either `scraped` or `estimated`.

For example the first trip of route 1 going to Klukkuvellir on a Monday is found in `timetables/1-A-Klukkuvellir/weekdays/1.csv`.

### Caveat

* These timetables are estimates.
* Some trips are missing.
